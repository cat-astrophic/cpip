## Examples

This folder contains the code used to provide several examples of cpip in action:

* There are csv files (a, b, and c) which contain adjacency matrices for artificially constructed examples.

* To save space the main data file and the state-level shapefile for the US are not included here.

* The MDPI network data used with the *cpip_IC.py* file is included in *Data.zip*.

* The US railway transportation data file comes from the 2012 Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) Public Use Microdata (PUM) File, and the shapefile was used to generate figures.

* The file *cpip_examples.py* runs the US railway analysis and the analyses of the artificial examples.

* The file *cpip_IC.py* runs the analyses for the MDPI international collaboration data set.
