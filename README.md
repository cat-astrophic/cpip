## Core-Periphery Integer Program (cpip)

* cpip is an in-development project which identifies the core of a network by using a paramterized algorithmic approach which solves a series of integer programs

* cpip uses only two parameters: one which places a constraint on the centrality of the core within the network, and one which puts a constraint on the density of the core

* cpip requires the following modules
    * **pulp** for solving the integer programs
    * **networkx** for visualizing networks and computing network statistics
    * **matplotlib** for general plotting
    * **itertools** for data manipulation
    * **pandas** for data manipulation
    * **numpy** for data manipulation

<!-- solves an initial linear program (display below) -->

<!-- loops through (show loop) -->
