## Core-Periphery Integer Program (cpip)

* cpip is an in-development project which uses a paramterized algorithmic approach, solving a series of integer programs, to identify the core of a network

* cpip uses only two parameters: one which places a constraint on the centrality of the core within the network, and one which puts a constraint on the density of the core


<!-- solves an initial linear program (display below) -->

<!-- loops through (show loop) -->
